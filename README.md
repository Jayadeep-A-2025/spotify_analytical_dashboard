# Spotify Data Dashboard â€“ Power BI

This project visualizes and analyzes Spotify song data to uncover patterns in **energy**, **danceability**, and **valence (positivity)**, helping identify the overall **mood of songs**.  
Built using **Microsoft Power BI**, this dashboard combines data analytics with music insights â€” transforming raw data into meaningful visual stories.

## Project Overview

The **Spotify Data Dashboard** provides a clear view of how different musical attributes interact and shape a listenerâ€™s experience.  
It classifies songs into mood categories based on their **energy**, **danceability**, and **valence** levels.

### Objectives
- Analyze song attributes to identify listening patterns.  
- Classify tracks into distinct **moods** like *Happy, Energetic, Calm,* and *Sad*.  
- Visualize data trends for better understanding of user preferences.  
- Practice and demonstrate **Power BI visualization and data modeling skills**.

---

## Key Insights
- Most tracks fall under **Happy / Energetic** and **Chill / Positive** moods, reflecting an optimistic listening trend.  
- Strong **correlation between Energy and Danceability** â€” upbeat songs are often more danceable.  
- Songs with high **valence** (positivity) dominate playlists, showing a general preference for feel-good music.  
- **Genre-based analysis** reveals that Pop and EDM tracks maintain higher energy and danceability levels.  
- The **Mood classification logic** combines key metrics to assign a mood label to each song dynamically.

## Tech Stack
- **Tool:** Power BI  
- **Dataset:** Spotify Tracks Dataset (Energy, Danceability, Valence, Tempo, Popularity, etc.)  
- **Techniques Used:**  
  - Power Query for data cleaning and transformation  
  - DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for mood calculation  
  - Interactive visuals, slicers, and charts for better storytelling
